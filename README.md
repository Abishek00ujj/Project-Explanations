# PROJECT EXPLANATION

## PROJECT NAME - SYNCTOGETHER
(SyncTogether - A product designed for real-time connection and entertainment)

I have developed a project called SyncTogether, a real-time entertainment platform designed to bring people closer no matter where they are.

### Inspiration
What inspired me to do this project? I always wondered, what if we could listen to songs together with friends while having real-time chat functionalities?

I thought there was no website or app like that, but then Spotify launched a group listening feature in its premium version. I tried that platform and realized that I could make it better and more affordable. So, I developed SyncTogether.

### Objectives
The objective of SyncTogether is to develop a product where people can listen to songs together with their friends or a group of people while having real-time chat functionalities. To enhance privacy and affordability, the chat does not use any database for storing messages.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** ReactJS  
- **Middleware:** ExpressJS  
- **Backend:** NodeJS  
- **Database:** MongoDB (used only for authentication purposes; no messages are stored to enhance data security)  
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth  
- **Real-time chat:** Socket.IO  
- **Music streaming:** YouTube API (used to bring YouTube data into the website to enhance the experience)

### Challenges Faced
The main challenge in this project was the YouTube API daily quota limit, which is only 2,000 requests per day. Each search request consumes one quota, meaning that if 10 people use the site simultaneously, the daily limit can be reached quickly. I overcame this problem by using the paid version of the YouTube API and optimizing my code efficiently.

### My Role in This Project
I worked as a full-stack developer in this project. I developed this entire project in just three days.

### Future Scope
This project has great potential. If published as a real product, it could be in huge demand since no existing website or app currently offers these features.

### Project Status
The project is currently in the testing stage, and my friends are testing it. In the future, this project will be promoted as a product.

Thank you!
